**Postmortem: Web Stack Outage Due to Database Connection Failure**

### **Issue Summary**
**Duration:** April 10, 2024, 14:05 - 15:30 UTC (1 hour 25 minutes)  
**Impact:** Our main web application experienced degraded performance, with over 70% of users unable to access key features such as login and content retrieval. API response times spiked, and some requests failed entirely.
**Root Cause:** A misconfigured database connection pool exhausted available connections, leading to application timeouts and failures.

---

### **Timeline**
- **14:05 UTC** - Issue detected via automated monitoring alert (increased API response time and high 500 error rates).
- **14:10 UTC** - On-call engineer investigates and identifies database timeouts as the probable cause.
- **14:20 UTC** - Initial assumption: Possible network connectivity issue between the application servers and database.
- **14:30 UTC** - Network logs show no anomalies. Focus shifts to application-level database interactions.
- **14:45 UTC** - Escalation to backend and database teams for further investigation.
- **14:55 UTC** - Investigation reveals a high number of idle database connections, leading to exhaustion of available connections.
- **15:10 UTC** - Temporary mitigation applied: Restarting application instances to free up connections.
- **15:20 UTC** - Connection pool settings updated to increase maximum connections and enforce proper connection release.
- **15:30 UTC** - Services fully restored, error rates return to normal.

### **Root Cause and Resolution**
#### **Root Cause**
The applicationâ€™s connection pool settings were misconfigured, leading to an excessive number of idle connections that were not being released back to the pool. As a result, new incoming requests could not acquire a database connection, causing timeouts and API failures. This issue was exacerbated by a recent increase in traffic, which put additional strain on the connection pool.

#### **Resolution**
The immediate fix involved restarting application instances to free up stuck connections. The long-term fix involved tuning the database connection pool settings:
- Reduced idle connection timeout to ensure timely release of unused connections.
- Increased maximum connection limits to better handle traffic spikes.
- Implemented database connection monitoring to track connection usage trends.

### **Corrective and Preventative Measures**
#### **Improvements and Fixes**
- Audit and optimize database connection pool settings.
- Improve database monitoring alerts for connection saturation.
- Conduct load testing to simulate high-traffic scenarios and ensure database settings scale appropriately.
- Improve documentation on connection pooling best practices for developers.

#### **Action Items**
- [ ] Patch and redeploy application with updated connection pool settings.
- [ ] Set up automated alerts for high idle connection counts.
- [ ] Conduct a post-incident review with the development team.
- [ ] Schedule regular performance testing for database-heavy operations.
- [ ] Improve observability by adding logging around database connection lifecycles.

This postmortem provides valuable insights into how misconfigurations can lead to service degradation and highlights the importance of proactive monitoring and proper resource management.
